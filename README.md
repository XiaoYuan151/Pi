# Pi
A simple Pi calculation program with customizable calculation digits\
We use multi-threaded calculations, calculating 32 bits each time to ensure no overflow, and automatically merge into the local file "Pi.txt"

## How to use
Eh, you need Python 3.8+ installed to run this program, and a powerful computer to support more digit operations
